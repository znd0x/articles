1) Are "Who Called Me?" Apps Secure?
Most of us use these kind of apps in our daily life. We become curious about who called us. Hackers take advantage of it and they write malicious scripts for stealing our personal data. I found a Turkish app in play store that people downloaded it more than 500.000. Developer created this app because of the same purpose that I told. In addition reviews of this app are great and people rated this app 4.9 out of 5. When I looked out for developers communication address there were just fake mail, fake location and also a fake website. I found other apps that he/she created and there were 2 more apps with same content but different name, logo. Each of them were downloaded more than 100.000 and their reviews were great too. I also analysed them. After I analysed I saw few critic spots about his/her apps.

These apps were stealing peoples contacts and more. If there is contact names like "passw0rd", "pass" etc. this application steals them too. In addition this app searches for e-mails, call logs, ssid, country, application names as well.
